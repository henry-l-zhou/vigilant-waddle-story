The turtle went on a journey to the faraway forest. To get there he first had to travel over a mountain.
The mountain was steep but he was able to climb to the top.  
When he reached the top, he found something he never thought he'd see for himself. There was a rabbit waiting for him, sleeping.
He asked the rabbit how he got there first, and the rabbit replied, "slow and steady never wins the race."
The turtle decided to continue on his journey at his own pace, and not worry about what others think about his accomplishments.
In the end, the turtle realized that rabbits are just mean.

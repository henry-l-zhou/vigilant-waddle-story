The turtle went on a journey to the faraway forest. To get there he first had to travel over a mountain.
The mountain was steep but he was able to climb to the top.  
When he reached the top, he found something he never thought he'd see for himself. There was a rabbit waiting for him, sleeping.
He asked the rabbit how he got there first, and the rabbit replied, "slow and steady never wins the race."
